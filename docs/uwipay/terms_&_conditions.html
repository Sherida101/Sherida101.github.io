  <strong>Terms &amp; Conditions</strong>
  <p>
    By downloading or using the application, these terms will
    automatically applicationly to you – you should make sure therefore
    that you read them carefully before using the application. You’re not
    allowed to copy, or modify the application, any part of the application, or
    our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to
    extract the source code of the application, and you also shouldn’t try
    to translate the application into other languages, or make derivative
    versions. The application itself, and all the trade marks, copyright,
    database rights and other intellectual property rights related
    to it, still belong to SATA Inc..
  </p>
  <p>
    SATA Inc. is committed to ensuring that the application is
    as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
    reserve the right to make changes to the application or to charge for
    its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never
    charge you for the application or its services without making it very
    clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
  </p>
  <p>
    The UWIPay application stores and processes personal data that
    you have provided to us, in order to provide our
    Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and
    access to the application secure. We therefore recommend that you do
    not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
    removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
    official operating system of your device. It could make your
    phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
    compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean
    that the UWIPay application won’t work properly or at all.

      The application does use third party services that declare their own
      Terms and Conditions.

  <p>
    You should be aware that there are certain things that
    SATA Inc. will not take responsibility for. Certain
    functions of the application will require the application to have an active
    internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided
    by your mobile network provider, but SATA Inc.
    cannot take responsibility for the application not working at full
    functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t
    have any of your data allowance left.
  </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>
    If you’re using the application outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
    should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
    mobile network provider will still applicationly. As a result, you may
    be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
    the duration of the connection while accessing the application, or
    other third party charges. In using the application, you’re accepting
    responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
    charges if you use the application outside of your home territory
    (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
    you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re
    using the application, please be aware that we assume that you have
    received permission from the bill payer for using the application.
  </p>
  <p>
    Along the same lines, SATA Inc. cannot always take
    responsibility for the way you use the application i.e. You need to
    make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
    battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service,
    SATA Inc. cannot accept responsibility.
  </p>
  <p>
    With respect to SATA Inc.’s responsibility for your
    use of the application, when you’re using the application, it’s important to
    bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is
    updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
    to provide information to us so that we can make it available
    to you. SATA Inc. accepts no liability for any
    loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
    relying wholly on this functionality of the application.
  </p>
  <p>
    At some point, we may wish to update the application. The application is
    currently available on Android &amp; iOS – the requirements for
    both systems(and for any additional systems we
    decide to extend the availability of the application to) may change,
    and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
    using the application. SATA Inc. does not promise that it
    will always update the application so that it is relevant to you
    and/or works with the Android &amp; iOS version that you have
    installed on your device. However, you promise to always
    accept updates to the applicationlication when offered to you, We may
    also wish to stop providing the application, and may terminate use of
    it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
    Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
    rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;
    (b) you must stop using the application, and (if needed) delete it
    from your device.
